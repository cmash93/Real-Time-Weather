# Real Time Weather App

## What I did:  
* I used the Open Weather API to gather weather data and display that data in real time.    
* I used three separate API urls to get data for current weather, five day forecast, and UV index.
* For the UV Index, I created attributes that would be applied based on certain UV parameters.    
* I wanted to add an extra detail to present background images that were based on condition as well as time. This required using getHours() to be able to calculate when certain images were used. I also needed to create a a way to organize the images based on weather codes that were obtained from the API.    
* I had a really good time with the CSS as well. Since the API provided so much information, I wanted to make sure I could display it in a clean, nicely aesthetic way.
